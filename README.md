Project#1
ODIN RECEPIES---
This is officaillly the first project on The Odin Project's website. Because this project is based only on HTML, I dont expect a flashy web page. however, I do expect I will enjoy completing this project. I am excited to apply all the HTML knowledge I have recently picked up. this includes, ordered lists, unordered lists, adding links and images.  Thank you The Odin Project. Three weeks ago I had no idea how to create a web page.
