    <h1>The Best Classic Chili -</h1>
        <p>This classic chili is perfect for a weeknight meal because it can be made in minutes.  The only thing to chop is an onion. <br>
            This traditional chili recipe is just like mom used to make with ground beef, beans, and a simple homemade blend of chili seasonings.</p>
        <p>I’ve been playing around with this chili recipe for the past few months, making it many times.<br>  
            My family didn’t mind the repetition at all because I really do believe that I ended up with the best chili ever!</p>
