    <h1>Banana Bread Recipe</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>I made this banana bread recipe when I had over ripe bananas and left-over buttermilk in the refrigerator that I didn’t know what to do with. <br> 
            I was so happy with the result.  This is now my go-to banana recipe.  It’s that good!</p>
        <p>This bread is great as soon as it’s cool enough to eat.  But, it’s even better if you can cover it and let it set in the refrigerator for a few hours. <br>
            I like to make it in the evening and serve it for breakfast the next day.  Letting the bread rest in the refrigerator makes it incredibly moist.  And, <br>
            it stays moist for days.</p>
            <br>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>        
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 medium overripe bananas, mashed with a fork (about 1 cup)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup canola oil (or your preferred cooking oil)</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
            <br>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the mashed banana and the eggs. Add the buttermilk, oil, sugar, and vanilla and mix well.</li>
            <li>Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Do not over mix.  Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes. When a toothpick is inserted into the center of the bread, it should come out with moist crumbs but with no raw batter on it.</li>
            <li>Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove the bread from the pan and place on a cooling rack to cool completely before slicing. Store covered in the refrigerator*.</li>
        </ol>
