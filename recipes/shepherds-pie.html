    <h1>Description</h1>    
        <p>The Best Classic Shepherd’s Pie – AKA Shepards Pie or Cottage Pie. Ground Beef (or lamb) with vegetables in a rich gravy, <br>
            topped with cheesy mashed potatoes, and baked.</p>
        <p>Traditional Irish Shepherd’s Pie would actually call for ground lamb.  The difference between Shepherd’s Pie and Cottage Pie is the meat. <br>
            Cottage Pie uses ground beef, while Shepherd’s Pie uses ground lamb. I called this recipe Shepherd’s Pie.  But, I wrote the recipe so that <br>
            you could use ground beef or ground lamb. I typically use ground beef because it is widely available.  But, for a special occasion, like <br>
            St. Patricks day, I would use ground lamb.</p>
